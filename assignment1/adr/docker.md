* **Title**: Choice of Docker containers.

* **Status**: Accepted

* **Context**: The assignment needs to be easily shared and run on another system.

* **Decision**: Docker is a good choice because it makes it easy to containerize an application and everything that is necessary for it to run. It packages up libraries and dependencies and simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running and application.

* **Consequences**: Docker containers are better than virtual machines because Docker containers are faster, less resource heavy, and perform better. A Docker container launches in just a few second while a virtual machine can take several minutes. Docker containers are also scalable and safer to use. Kubernetes a container orchestration system for Docker containers. Kubernetes is similar to Docker but it is not a complete solution and is meant to include custom plugins.
